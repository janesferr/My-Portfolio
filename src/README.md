#  React Portfolio

I am working with React and have multiple projects to share and updated my portfolio and other materials to build toward being employer ready.  I am creating this website as part of my journey as a developer to share with you.  

## Information

* My updated portfolio features 6 total projects

* Using React

* It has `Header` component that appears on multiple pages

* A single `Project` component that will be used multiple times on a single page 

* Navigation with React Router, dynamic rendering, or another third part router

* A `Footer` component that appears on multiple pages

* I have updated my GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring my projects

* I have deployed this website: https://janesferr.github.io/Portofolio-React/

Using this instructions and video: [Create React App docs for deployment.]
* (https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages)

As with the previous portfolio homework, "good" design is subjective. Your site should look
"polished." Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

* Mobile-first design

* Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.

* Make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.

* If you want to go above and beyond, try using animations and react component libraries. Note 
that this will _not_ affect your grade, but it may impact how potentials employers gauge your knowledge.

### React

Additionally, this new portfolio should be created using React.

At a minimum, your portfolio should include the following:

* A `Header` component that appears on multiple pages

* A single `Project` component that will be used multiple times on a single page 

* Navigation with React Router, dynamic rendering, or another third part router

* A `Footer` component that appears on multiple pages
